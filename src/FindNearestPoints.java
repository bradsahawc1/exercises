Given a set of points, the closest-pair problem is to find the two points that are nearest to each other. 
In Figure, for example, points (1, 1) and (2, 0.5) are closest to each other. 
There are several ways to solve this problem. 
An intuitive approach is to compute the distances between all pairs of points and find the one with 
the minimum distance, as implemented in Listing 8.3.
